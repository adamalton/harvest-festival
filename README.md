# Harvest Festival

A browser extension for Google Chrome to make the harvestapp.com time tracking UI less annoying.

This extension improves the Harvest web UI by:

* Moving the overlay box when adding a new time entry so that you can still see the existing entries behind it.
    - This is useful because sometimes you have an entry which is serving the purpose of "everything else" for the day. So you want to set the time to "8 hours minus however much I've already logged". And in order to do that, you need to see how much time you've already logged.


Future things to add:
* Up/down/left/right navigation with the arrows in the week view.
* Remove chosen.js and replace it with something which will match on _any_ words in the title, not only consecutive words.  Because 2005 was years ago and we can do this shit better now.
